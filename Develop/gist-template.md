## Regex Components
    

### Anchors

Anchors, like the name implies, are used to define or hold a position before, after, or within the characters. The dollar sign $ and the carot ^ are the end and beginning of the regular expression. 

### Quantifiers


### OR Operator
Not used for this regex

### Character Classes

### Flags

### Grouping and Capturing

### Bracket Expressions

Brackets allow a regex to match characters within a range. So within our email regex it is analyzing [a-z0-9_\.-] and is looking for any letter a-z and any number 0-9. 

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

### Back-references

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
